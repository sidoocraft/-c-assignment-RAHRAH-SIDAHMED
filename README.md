FCFS Process Scheduler Simulator Introduction

In modern operating systems, CPU scheduling is a critical function that determines the order in which processes access the CPU. The First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm is one of the simplest and most intuitive. It follows a non-preemptive queue-based system, where the process that arrives first is executed first.

The FCFS Process Scheduler Simulator is a tool designed to help students, developers, and enthusiasts visualize the behavior of FCFS scheduling, calculate process metrics, and analyze the impact of process order on system performance.
